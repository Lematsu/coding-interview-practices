# Interview Practices
## Overview
I compiled the material I studied over the past 2 months to prepare for Software Development Engineer role interviews.  The content below was organized into three sections, coding, system design, and behavioral. My main focus while studying was coding, specifically practicing Leetcode problems. For the coding section, I've added some of my approaches in the jupyer notebooks with original questions obtained from Leetcode or another source sited in the notebook. I believe SDE inteviews required different skillsets than academic and professional development experiences. It helped me greatly when I took some time and went over the material to understand what would be asked during the interview.

- Whiteboard Coding Interview approach
    - I thought it was important to mention on how you should approach answering questions in whiteboard interview questions. I have listed the generalized steps below:
        1. Repeat: make sure you do understand the problem.
        2. Example: get insights by doing examples 
        3. Approach: come up with your approach(es) to the problem (brute force first)
        4. Code: write the code for your chosen approach
        5. Testing: pass the testcases
        6. Optimize: optimize the complexities (time and space) of your algorithm
    - Here's a good Youtube video that talks about this approach. [FullStack Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIR_rxusO8Q&)
