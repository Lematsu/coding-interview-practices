    "We could approach this problem in a dynamic programming where where we update the data per iteration. We could identify this problem as a dynamic programming question because given a matrix with a starting condition, we update the matrix cells row by row. We could initially create the matrix, and give the row = 0 and col = 0 values as ones, since there is only one path going straight right and straight down. Then, for row = 1 onward and col = 1 onward, we could add the sums of the row - 1 and col - 1 values together for the left over cells. The total paths would be recorded in the bottom righ corner cell, which is the cell the robot is trying to reach. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m* n) because we're iterating over both m and n. The space complexity is also O(m * n) because we store the matrix to dynamically update the content inside."
