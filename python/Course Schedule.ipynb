    "We can use hash maps to express the relationships between course and prerequisite. By doing so, we would be able to traverse the course list of prerequisites and check if we have already taken the course. With our hash map, we want to be able to create a set that shows us which courses were possible to take within the number courses we have. The runtime of this algorithm would be exponential since for each course, we traverse through the dictionary to see if we have taken it before. Our space complexity will be linear since we're either only created the hash map or recursive stack.\n",
