    "Output: 3 \n",

    "Input: \"bbbbb\"\n",
    "Output: 1\n",

    "We could approach this problem by using a dictionary to store the last seen index of a character. By doing so, we could reduce the time complexity to using a queue and having to iterate over the queue to see the last seen index of a character. With a dictionary, we could check if a character has already been seen in $O(1)$ and because we store the last index, we have that information in $O(1)$ as well. We utilize the formula of distance to figure out the length of the substring with the following: $\\text{distance} = \\text{iterative index} - \\text{start of substring} + 1$. For a duplicate character, we could calculate the start of the substring as follows `start = dict[c] + 1` since we want the next letter after the duplicate. Finally, by maintaining a `maxLength` variable, we could compare the length of each substring after each iteration of the string. The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$ due to n number of characters in a string. The space complexity is $O(n)$ again due to n number of characters in a string."
